## gitflow

Take a look at [this blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## cactus model

Take a look at [this blog post](https://barro.github.io/2016/02/a-succesful-git-branching-model-considered-harmful/).

## Stable Mainline

Take a look at [this blog post](http://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-stable-mainline-branching-model-for-git/). [This post about branch by abstraction](https://continuousdelivery.com/2011/05/make-large-scale-changes-incrementally-with-branch-by-abstraction/) is also a good read on linear histories and why having long-term feature branches especially when refactoring is a bad idea.

**TODO:** Although the above-mentioned blog posts are good consistent documents, it would be nice to have a condensed TL;DR version here for the busy readers.
